# SMS Spam Detection

This project aims to identify and filter out spam SMS messages using various machine learning models. The analysis and model training were conducted using a dataset from Kaggle named `spam.csv`.

## Project Steps 🛠️

- **Data Cleaning:** Clean and prepare data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data to uncover insights.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Process text data for machine learning.
- **Model Building:** Train various models to classify messages.
- **Evaluation:** Compare model accuracy and precision.
- **Improvement:** Optimize models through tuning and advanced techniques.
- **Website:** Deploy the best model online for easy interaction.

## Models Tested 📊

- Naive Bayes (Binomial, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
- Logistic Regression
- SVC
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Ada Boost
